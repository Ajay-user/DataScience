The window of inputs adds memory to the problem, but is limited to just a fixed number of points and must be chosen with sufficient knowledge of the problem. A naive window would not capture the broader trends over minutes, hours and days that might be relevant to making a prediction. From one prediction to the next, the network only knows about the specific inputs it is provided.\n",
