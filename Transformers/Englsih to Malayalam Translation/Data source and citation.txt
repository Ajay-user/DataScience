Warning! There are errors in the Tatoeba Corpus. (Detailed Warning)
In order to minimize the number of errors, I only used sentences that were owned by identified native speakers working on the Tatoeba Project and English sentences that I've personally checked and did not reject.
Warning! Please remember that even doing this may not have eliminated all errors.
